1. Open the app
2. Navigate to "List a Spot" or "Book a Spot"
3. **Expected**: App should request location permission
4. **Action**: Grant location permission when prompted

### 3. Test "My Location" Button - ListSpotPage
1. Go to "List a Spot" page

2. Look for the white circular button with location icon (top-right corner)
3. Tap the "My Location" button
4. **Expected**: Map should animate to your current location

### 5. Test Error Scenarios

**Location Services Disabled:**
1. Disable location services in device settings
2. Try the "My Location" button
3. **Expected**: Red SnackBar with message about enabling location services

**Permission Denied:**
1. Deny location permission in app settings
2. Try the "My Location" button  
3. **Expected**: Red SnackBar with message about enabling location permissions

2. Try the "My Location" button
3. **Expected**: Orange SnackBar about timeout after 15 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "No location permissions are defined in the manifest"
1. Ensure you're testing on a physical device (not web)
2. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. Rebuild the app completely
4. Check that location services are enabled on the device

### If the button doesn't appear
1. Ensure you're on the correct pages (ListSpotPage or BookSpotPage)
2. Look for a small white circular button in the top-right corner of the map
3. The button should have a location/target icon

### If location doesn't work
1. Check device location settings
2. Try outdoors for better GPS signal
3. Grant all location permissions to the app
4. Check the Flutter console for detailed error messages
